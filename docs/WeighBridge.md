# Project Proposal: Automated Weighbridge System  
![Chunga Weighbridge Setup](weigh-bridge-image.png)


## **Overview**

This proposal outlines the implementation of an **automated weighbridge management system** at the Chunga dumpsite, utilizing existing Laumas WINOX-BR weighbridge controllers. The system will automate the measurement and tracking of vehicle weights at entry and exit, integrating license plate recognition (LPR) to accurately manage vehicle data and calculate garbage loads. Licence plates will be associated to collectors so no need for manual entry and for when a collector hires out a vehicle, they will need to register that vehicle on the platform as a temp vehicle for this collection task so that by the time the vehicle gets to the dump site that record will already be there.

## **Project Objectives**

- Automate and streamline weighbridge operations.
- Accurately track and record vehicle weights.
- Automatically recognize vehicles by their number plates.
- Maintain continuous operation with built-in redundancy and offline capabilities.
- Securely store data locally and synchronize to cloud services.

---

## **System Architecture**

The system involves the following key components:

1. **Existing Weighbridge Controllers:**
   - Two (2) Laumas WINOX-BR controllers (already available).
   - Connected via RS-485 communication protocol.

2. **IoT Gateway (LM Gateway 101 IoT-Lite):**
   - Polls weight data from controllers using Modbus RTU.
   - Centralized gateway capable of handling both weighbridge controllers through RS-485 multi-drop (daisy-chain) setup.

3. **Vehicle Detection Cameras:**
   - Four (4) REOLINK RLC-811A 4K IP cameras.
   - Positioned to automatically capture clear images of vehicle license plates from both directions of each weighbridge.

4. **Local Server (Mac Mini 2024 - M4 Chip):**
   - Performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) locally to detect vehicle number plates.
   - Hosts local database for vehicle base weights, images, timestamps, and computed garbage weights.
   - Provides offline operational capability.

5. **Networking Infrastructure:**
   - Ethernet network using Cat6 cable, powered and connected through an 8-port PoE switch.

6. **Backup and Redundancy:**
   - Local data storage (Mac Mini internal storage).
   - External HDD for additional data backup.
   - Continuous data synchronization to cloud storage when internet is available.
   - Existing Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) ensures reliable power.

---

## **Detailed Workflow**

1. **Vehicle Arrival Detection:**  
   - Cameras detect vehicle approaching via motion sensors, capturing clear images.

2. **Weight Measurement:**  
   - Laumas WINOX-BR controllers measure vehicle weight.
   - LM Gateway polls data using Modbus RTU and timestamps the readings.

3. **License Plate Recognition:**  
   - Captured images processed by local OCR running on Mac Mini, extracting license plate numbers.

4. **Data Processing & Storage:**  
   - System retrieves vehicle base weight from the local database by recognized license plate.
   - Computes garbage weight (entry weight minus exit weight).
   - Data (weights, images, license plate, timestamp) stored locally, and periodically synchronized to the cloud.

5. **Offline Capability:**  
   - During internet outages, operations continue uninterrupted.
   - All data buffered locally, automatically synced once connectivity returns.
