## **Introduction**

The Lusaka Integrated Solid Waste Management Company (LISWMC) aims to modernize waste management in Lusaka by implementing a robust, scalable, and efficient backend architecture. This architecture supports various stakeholders, including LISWMC staff, franchise collectors, landfill operators, and citizens. It provides functionalities such as payment management, real-time tracking, fleet management, landfill operations, and advanced zone classification using Google Earth Engine APIs.

This document outlines a detailed backend architecture incorporating **gRPC** for inter-service communication and implementing a **Backend For Frontend (BFF)** pattern. The architecture is designed to be highly modular, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that it meets both current and future needs of the platform, including the new landfill operations.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

The backend architecture consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the system. The microservices communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. The **BFF Service** acts as the gateway between client applications and the backend microservices, exposing RESTful APIs to the clients and translating these into gRPC calls to the microservices.

**Key Components:**

- **Clients:** Mobile applications (Android/iOS), web applications, USSD services, landfill gate systems.
- **BFF Service:** Acts as a mediator between clients and microservices.
- **Microservices:** Independently deployable services responsible for specific functionalities.
- **Database Layer:** PostgreSQL database accessed by microservices.
- **External Integrations:** Payment gateways, mapping services, messaging platforms, Google Earth Engine APIs.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Centralized service managing user authentication and authorization.
- **Infrastructure Components:** Container orchestration, load balancing, monitoring, and logging tools.

## **Data Flow and Interactions**

### **1. Landfill Entry and Dumping Process**

**Step 1:** Vehicle arrives at the landfill gate.

**Step 2:** Landfill operator uses the **Landfill Management System** (client interface) to:

- **Check Registration:**
  - If the vehicle and user are pre-registered, retrieve their details.
  - If not, register the vehicle and user by collecting:
    - Vehicle registration number.
    - Driver's name and contact information.
    - Company or personal address.

**Step 3:** Landfill operator records the **Dumping Activity**:

- **Waste Details:**
  - Quantity of waste (measured by weight or volume).
  - Nature of waste (type, hazardous materials, etc.).

**Step 4:** Landfill operator initiates payment:

- **BFF Service** receives payment initiation request.
- BFF calls **Payment Service** via gRPC with payment details.

**Step 5:** Payment Service interacts with mobile money API to initiate the transaction.

**Step 6:** User completes payment on their mobile device.

**Step 7:** Mobile money provider sends payment notification to Payment Service.

**Step 8:** Payment Service verifies transaction and updates payment status.

**Step 9:** Payment Service notifies **Landfill Management Service** of successful payment.

**Step 10:** Landfill operator receives confirmation and allows vehicle entry.

**Step 11:** **Notification Service** sends payment confirmation and entry receipt to the user.

### **2. User Registration and Authentication (Including Landfill Users)**

- **Same as previous steps**, with the addition that landfill users can be registered either in advance or at the landfill gate.

### **3. Payment Processing for Landfill Fees**

- **Same flow as household payments**, but tailored for landfill dumping fees.

### **4. Data Synchronization for Offline Operations**

- **Challenge:** Landfill may have intermittent connectivity.
- **Solution:**

  - **Offline Data Capture:**
    - Landfill Management System operates offline, storing data locally.
  - **Periodic Synchronization:**
    - When connectivity is restored, data syncs with backend services.
  - **Conflict Resolution:**
    - Implement mechanisms to handle duplicate entries or conflicts during synchronization.
