# **Enhancing the Payment Processing System to Handle Unreliable Mobile Money Transactions**

---

## **Introduction**

Mobile money transactions, while convenient, can be unreliable due to network issues, timeouts, and service disruptions. These problems can lead to transactions hanging or failing, causing confusion for users and potentially leading to double payments if not handled correctly. It is crucial for the Lusaka Integrated Solid Waste Management Platform to implement a robust payment processing system that can handle these uncertainties while ensuring that double payments do not occur.

This document outlines strategies and architectural enhancements to the payment processing system to address these challenges.

## **Challenges with Mobile Money Transactions**

1. **Transaction Hanging:**
   - Transactions may remain in a pending state due to network issues.
   - Users may not receive immediate confirmation, leading them to attempt the payment again.

2. **Transaction Failures:**
   - Payments may fail after initiation but before confirmation.
   - Failure reasons can include insufficient funds, service downtime, or technical errors.

3. **Double Payments:**
   - Users may unintentionally make multiple payments for the same invoice.
   - The system may process duplicate payments if not correctly identified.

---

## **Proposed Solutions**

### **1. Implement Idempotent Payment Operations**

**What is Idempotency?**

Idempotency ensures that multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request. In payment processing, this means that if a user initiates the same payment multiple times, only one successful transaction is recorded and processed.

**How to Implement:**

- **Unique Transaction Identifiers:**
  - Assign a unique `PaymentRequestID` to each payment attempt.
  - Use UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to ensure uniqueness across the system.

- **Idempotency Keys:**
  - Store the `PaymentRequestID` as an idempotency key in the database.
  - Before processing a payment, check if a transaction with the same idempotency key has already been processed.

- **Handling Duplicate Requests:**
  - If a duplicate payment request is received, return the result of the original transaction instead of processing a new one.

**Benefits:**

- Prevents double charging the user.
- Ensures consistent system state even if the user retries the payment.

### **2. Implement a Robust Transaction State Machine**

**Transaction States:**

1. **Initiated:** The payment process has started.
2. **Pending:** Awaiting confirmation from the mobile money provider.
3. **Success:** Payment has been successfully processed and confirmed.
4. **Failed:** Payment has failed; reasons are logged.
5. **Expired:** Pending payments that have not been confirmed within a timeout period.

**How to Implement:**

- **State Management:**
  - Use a finite state machine to manage the lifecycle of a transaction.
  - Update transaction states based on events received (e.g., callbacks from mobile money APIs).

- **Timeouts and Retries:**
  - Implement timeouts for pending transactions.
  - Retry mechanisms for transient failures.

- **Audit Trail:**
  - Log all state transitions with timestamps for auditing and reconciliation.

### **3. Utilize Asynchronous Payment Confirmation (Callback/Webhooks)**

**Why Asynchronous Confirmation?**

Mobile money providers often use asynchronous callbacks (webhooks) to notify the system about the payment status. Relying solely on immediate responses can lead to inaccuracies due to network delays or service disruptions.

**How to Implement:**

- **Payment Initiation:**
  - When a payment is initiated, the system records the transaction with a `Pending` status.

- **Callback Endpoint:**
  - Expose a secure endpoint for mobile money providers to send payment confirmations.
  - Validate the authenticity of the callback using signatures or tokens.

- **State Update:**
  - Upon receiving the callback, update the transaction state to `Success` or `Failed` based on the provided information.

**Benefits:**

- Ensures the system only marks transactions as successful upon confirmed receipt of funds.
- Handles delayed confirmations gracefully.

### **4. Implement Payment Reconciliation Processes**

**What is Reconciliation?**

Reconciliation is the process of ensuring that the internal transaction records match the records from the mobile money providers.

**How to Implement:**

- **Daily Reconciliation Jobs:**
  - Schedule automated jobs to compare internal records with provider transaction logs.
  - Identify any discrepancies or missing transactions.

- **Manual Intervention:**
  - Provide administrative tools for staff to manually reconcile and correct transactions if necessary.

- **User Notifications:**
  - Inform users if discrepancies are found and corrective actions are taken.

**Benefits:**

- Maintains data integrity and financial accuracy.
- Builds trust with users by proactively managing issues.

### **5. Provide Clear User Feedback and Notifications**

**Why is User Feedback Important?**

Users need to understand the status of their payments to prevent confusion and repeated attempts.

**How to Implement:**

- **Real-Time Status Updates:**
  - Show payment status in the user interface (e.g., `Processing`, `Completed`, `Failed`).

- **Notifications:**
  - Send SMS or push notifications upon successful payment or if a payment fails.

- **Instructional Messages:**
  - Provide guidance on what to do if a payment is pending for an extended period.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces user anxiety and unnecessary repeated payment attempts.
- Enhances user experience and satisfaction.

### **6. Handle Edge Cases and Failure Scenarios**

**Possible Scenarios:**

- **Partial Payments:**
  - Payment is partially processed due to system errors.

- **Duplicate Callbacks:**
  - The system receives multiple callbacks for the same transaction.

- **Network Failures:**
  - Network issues prevent the system from receiving confirmation in a timely manner.

**How to Implement:**

- **Atomic Transactions:**
  - Ensure database operations for a payment are atomic to prevent partial updates.

- **Idempotent Callbacks:**
  - Use transaction IDs to ensure that duplicate callbacks do not affect the system state.

- **Retry Logic:**
  - Implement retries for network calls to mobile money APIs with exponential backoff.

- **Fallback Mechanisms:**
  - If the mobile money provider is unreachable, queue the payment request for later processing.

### **7. Security and Compliance**

**Ensuring Secure Transactions:**

- **Data Encryption:**
  - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.

- **Secure APIs:**
  - Use HTTPS for all API communications.
  - Implement authentication and authorization for all endpoints.

- **Compliance:**
  - Adhere to PCI DSS standards for handling payment information.
  - Regularly audit and update security protocols.

**Benefits:**

- Protects user data and financial information.
- Complies with regulatory requirements.

### **8. Logging and Monitoring**

**Why Logging and Monitoring are Crucial:**

- Allows for real-time detection of issues.
- Facilitates troubleshooting and debugging.

**How to Implement:**

- **Transaction Logging:**
  - Log all payment requests, responses, and state changes with detailed information.

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor system health and transaction metrics.

- **Alerting Mechanisms:**
  - Set up alerts for failed transactions, high failure rates, or system errors.

**Benefits:**

- Enables proactive issue resolution.
- Improves system reliability.

### **Proposed Enhancements for Tap-Based Payments in High-Density Neighborhoods**

In some high-density areas, water and garbage collection fees are combined and tied to a shared water tap that may serve multiple households (up to five or six). Traditionally, a single fee has been paid per tap, but to accommodate illegal connections and provide accountability, the system must:

1. Record the precise location of each tap (GPS coordinates or a reference to a zone).  
2. Allow for either:  
   • "Shared" billing where only one payment is expected per tap.  
   • "Individualized" billing where each tenant or occupant linked to a specific tap pays separately—even if they share water from the same tap.  
3. Flag and track any suspicious connections or unregistered households that use the same tap.
4. Store the number of tenants or occupants per tap to determine if fees are being underpaid.

### **Technical Considerations**

- When initiating mobile money transactions, the Payment Service should accept a "TapID" in addition to the usual "UserID," allowing the system to determine which tenants or households are linked to that tap.  
- Leveraging idempotent payment requests is even more critical here to prevent double charging any tenant or the entire tap.  
- The callback workflow (for confirming mobile money payments) must verify the tap or tenant associations to ensure correct attribution of fees.
