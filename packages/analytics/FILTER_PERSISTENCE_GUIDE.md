# Filter Persistence with Live Data Updates

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

**Before**: When auto-refresh happened, filtered views became stale and filters were lost.

**Now**: Filters automatically reapply to fresh data, keeping your filtered view current with live updates.

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Filter State Management**
- **Filter state stored separately** from filtered data
- **Persists filter criteria**: dates, companies, vehicles, locations, delivery type
- **Tracks if filters are active** to know when to reapply

### **2. Automatic Filter Reapplication**
```
User applies filters → Filter state saved → Data filtered → Display results
         ↓
Auto-refresh occurs → Fresh data loaded → Filters reapplied → Updated display
```

### **3. Smart Data Flow**
- **Manual refresh**: Always preserves active filters
- **Auto-refresh**: Reapplies filters to fresh data automatically
- **Reset filters**: Clears filter state and shows all data
- **Charts/tables**: Automatically update with filtered fresh data

## 💡 **User Experience**

### **What You Can Do Now:**
1. **Set up filters once** - date range, companies, delivery type, etc.
2. **Keep exploring** - data automatically stays current
3. **No re-filtering needed** - filters persist through refresh cycles
4. **Live monitoring** - filtered view shows fresh data as it comes in

### **Example Workflow:**
```
1. Filter: "Show only Company ABC, Normal Disposal, Last 7 days"
2. Explore the data, create insights
3. Auto-refresh happens (every 5 minutes)
4. Your filtered view automatically updates with fresh Company ABC data
5. Continue analysis without interruption
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **New Components Added:**

1. **Filter State Store** (`filter-state`)
   - Persists current filter criteria
   - Tracks if filters are active
   - Survives data refresh cycles

2. **Auto-Reapply Callback** (`reapply_filters_after_refresh`)
   - Triggers after data refresh
   - Reads stored filter state
   - Reapplies filters to fresh data

3. **Enhanced Filter Callback** (`filter_data`)
   - Saves filter state when filters applied
   - Returns both filtered data and filter state

4. **Improved Reset Callback** (`reset_filters`)
   - Clears both filtered data and filter state
   - Ensures clean reset
