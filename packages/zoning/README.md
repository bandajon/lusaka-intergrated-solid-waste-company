# Zoning Management System

A comprehensive zoning management system for waste collection routes and area management.

## Overview

The zoning system manages geographical areas, collection routes, and vehicle assignments for optimal waste collection efficiency in Lusaka.

## Features (Planned)

### 🗺️ Zone Management
- **Area Definition**: Create and manage collection zones
- **Route Planning**: Optimize collection routes
- **Coverage Analysis**: Ensure complete area coverage

### 🚛 Vehicle Assignment
- **Route Optimization**: Assign vehicles to optimal routes
- **Capacity Planning**: Balance vehicle loads
- **Schedule Management**: Plan collection schedules

### 📊 Analytics Integration
- **Performance Metrics**: Zone-wise collection analytics
- **Route Efficiency**: Track route performance
- **Resource Optimization**: Optimize vehicle and staff allocation

## Technology Stack

**To be determined based on requirements:**
- Backend: Python/Node.js/Java
- Database: PostgreSQL (shared with analytics)
- Frontend: React/Vue.js/Angular
- Mapping: OpenStreetMap/Google Maps API
- Optimization: OR-Tools/OSRM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [To be defined]
- Shared database access (PostgreSQL)
- Mapping API access

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to zoning package
cd packages/zoning

# Install dependencies (example)
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configuration

```env
# Shared Database (same as analytics)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name

# Mapping Services
MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-api-key

# Zoning Specific Configuration
ZONING_PORT=5008
```

## Planned Features

### Phase 1: Basic Zone Management
- [ ] Create and edit zones
- [ ] Basic route planning
- [ ] Integration with analytics database

### Phase 2: Route Optimization
- [ ] Automated route optimization
- [ ] Vehicle assignment algorithms
- [ ] Schedule management

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
- [ ] Performance analytics
- [ ] Predictive modeling
- [ ] Resource optimization

## Integration with Analytics

The zoning system will integrate with the analytics package by:

1. **Shared Database**: Using the same PostgreSQL database
2. **Zone-based Analytics**: Providing zone identifiers for analytics
3. **Route Efficiency Metrics**: Feeding performance data to analytics
4. **Shared Authentication**: Using the same auth system

## Development Status

🚧 **This package is currently in planning phase**

To contribute to the zoning system development:

1. Review the requirements with the development team
2. Choose appropriate technology stack
3. Set up basic project structure
4. Implement core zone management features

## API Endpoints (Planned)

```
GET    /zones              # List all zones
POST   /zones              # Create new zone
GET    /zones/:id          # Get zone details
PUT    /zones/:id          # Update zone
DELETE /zones/:id          # Delete zone

GET    /routes             # List routes
POST   /routes/optimize    # Optimize routes
GET    /routes/:id         # Get route details

GET    /vehicles           # List vehicles
POST   /vehicles/assign    # Assign vehicle to route
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the monorepo structure and conventions
2. Ensure integration compatibility with analytics package
3. Use shared components from `packages/shared/`
4. Add comprehensive tests for new features
