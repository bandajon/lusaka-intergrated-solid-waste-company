# WebSocket Real-time Analytics for Zone Creation

## Overview

The Lusaka Zoning Platform now includes **real-time analytics** during zone creation. When drawing a zone on the map, users receive immediate feedback about:

- Population estimates
- Waste generation projections
- Collection feasibility
- Zone viability scoring
- Critical issues and recommendations

## Features

### 1. Real-time Progress Updates
- Live progress bars for each analysis module
- Visual feedback as analysis runs
- Error handling with clear messages

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis Modules
- **Geometry Analysis**: Area, perimeter, shape quality
- **Population Estimation**: Multiple data sources with cross-validation
- **Settlement Classification**: Building patterns and density analysis
- **Waste Analysis**: Daily/monthly generation estimates
- **Collection Feasibility**: Truck requirements and route optimization
- **AI Insights**: Smart recommendations based on zone characteristics

### 3. Offline Mode Support
- Graceful fallback when Earth Engine is unavailable
- Enhanced area-based estimates for reliable planning
- Clear indication of which components are offline

## How to Use

### 1. Access the WebSocket-enabled Zone Creation

Navigate to: **Dashboard → Quick Actions → "Create with Analytics"**

Or directly visit: `/zones/create/websocket`

### 2. Draw Your Zone

1. Enter zone details (name, type, etc.)
2. Use the drawing tools to create your zone boundary
3. Watch as real-time analytics appear on the right panel

### 3. Review Analytics Results

The analytics panel shows:
- **Viability Score**: Overall zone assessment (0-10)
- **Key Metrics**: Population, area, waste generation
- **Critical Issues**: Problems that need attention
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **WebSocket Manager** (`websocket_manager.py`)
   - Handles real-time communication
   - Room-based messaging for isolated sessions
   - Progress and result broadcasting

2. **Enhanced Real-time Zone Analyzer** (`real_time_zone_analyzer.py`)
   - Integrates all analysis modules
   - Provides offline fallbacks
   - Generates comprehensive insights

3. **WebSocket Client** (`websocket_client.js`)
   - Browser-side WebSocket handling
   - Progress UI updates
   - Error handling and reconnection

4. **WebSocket Integration** (`websocket_integration.py`)
   - Flask-SocketIO initialization
   - Mixin classes for analytics integration

### Data Flow

1. User draws zone → Geometry sent to server
2. Server creates WebSocket session → Starts analysis
3. Analyzer runs modules → Sends progress updates
4. Client receives updates → Updates UI in real-time
5. Analysis complete → Zone saved with insights

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

```bash
cd packages/zoning
python run.py
```

The application will start with WebSocket support on `http://localhost:5001`
