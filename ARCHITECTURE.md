## **Introduction**

The Lusaka Integrated Solid Waste Management Company (LISWMC) seeks to modernize waste management in Lusaka by implementing a robust, scalable, and efficient backend architecture. This architecture supports various stakeholders, including LISWMC staff, franchise collectors, and citizens, providing functionalities such as payment management, real-time tracking, fleet management, and advanced zone classification using Google Earth Engine APIs.

This document outlines a detailed backend architecture based on the system design provided, incorporating **gRPC** for inter-service communication and implementing a **Backend For Frontend (BFF)** pattern. The architecture is designed to be highly modular, scalable, and maintainable, ensuring that it meets both current and future needs of the platform.

---

## **Architecture Overview**

The backend architecture is composed of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the system. The microservices communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. The **BFF Service** acts as the gateway between client applications and the backend microservices, exposing RESTful APIs to the clients and translating these into gRPC calls to the microservices.

**Key Components:**

- **Clients:** Mobile applications (Android/iOS), web applications, USSD services.
- **BFF Service:** Acts as a mediator between clients and microservices.
- **Microservices:** Independently deployable services responsible for specific functionalities.
- **Database Layer:** PostgreSQL database accessed by microservices.
- **External Integrations:** Payment gateways, mapping services, messaging platforms, Google Earth Engine APIs.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Centralized service managing user authentication and authorization.
- **Infrastructure Components:** Container orchestration, load balancing, monitoring, and logging tools.
